 * First write a method called gcd() to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive
 *  integers using Euclidean algorithm. Then write a main() method that requests two positive integers
 *   from the user, validates the input, calls the gcd() method to compute the GCD, and outputs the 
 *   return value of the gcd method() (all user input and output should be done in main()).
 *   Check Wikipedia to find more information about GCDs and Euclidean algorithm.  
 *   Below is a pseudocode for calculating the GCD, which you might find it useful:
 *   method gcd(a, b) {
    while (b â‰  0) {
        t = b
        b = a mod b 
        a = t
    }
    return a
}

 * Test your program with the following data:
 * Enter a: 34
 * Enter b: 289
 * The GCD of 34 and 289 is 17
